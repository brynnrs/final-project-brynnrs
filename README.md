# **Children's Daily Reading <br>& Activity Tracker**

## **My Project Proposal**

### **Build Concept & Reasoning:**
Life gets busy. And as a parent of young children, you've got to juggle your responsibilities along with theirs. As if getting them to school and all of their appointments wasn't enough, you also need to help them manage their time, remember to do their homework, teach them to clean up after themselves... and the list goes on and on. So even though you love them and are willing to do anything for them, remembering it all is near impossible, and there *will* be things forgotten...like required reading. 

As a single parent, I, too, struggle to stay on top of all the little things that can easily fall by the wayside in the daily hustle. At first, it isn't that big of a deal if they forget to read or turn in their tracking sheets. After all, they're still learning their ABCs! But eventually, they'll be at the age where they're held accountable for reading, exercising, and tracking these activities. Which means? You guessed it! Mom or Dad gets to do it. If only there was something that could help...

My Children's Daily Reading and Activity Tracker will be a web app that tracks daily reading time, book titles read, reading method (independent or with help), and exercise minutes for children. It will provide an easy way to quickly log details each day, view weekly summaries, create monthly reports, and even set reminders to read and/or track. Additionally, there will be visual progress indicators and celebratory pop-ups when milestones or goals are met to keep children involved and excited. This will make it easier for parents to complete school forms at the end of each week or month and encourage children to stay engaged with their goals.


### **Main Features**

1. **Daily Log Entry**:
   - A form where users can log each child’s:
     - Book titles
     - Reading time (in minutes)
     - Whether they read alone or with help
     - Exercise time (in minutes), starred if it meets the 30-minute goal
   
2. **Progress Tracking**:
   - A progress bar for each child to visualize weekly reading and exercise goals.
   - Fun alerts upon reaching milestone achievements for motivation. (e.g. "100 minutes read!" or "5 books completed!") 

3. **Weekly View & Summaries**:
   - Past entries will be displayed in a horizontal weekly timeline for quick review of the previous days.
   - At the end of each week, users can view the sum total of reading and exercise minutes for each child to simplify filling out school tracking sheets.

4. **Monthly View and Export**
   - The current month overview will be represented with a calendar.
   - Stars (exercise) and/or check marks (reading) of different colors will indicate if each child's tracking is complete for each individual day.
   - Users can click on a specific day to view that days complete stats. 
   - Users will have the option to export the monthly overview and summary as a PDF.
  
5. **Reminders and Notifications**
   - Optional reminders can be set to log the day's reading and exercise information.
   - Users receive a notification at the end of the week if there are days left unlogged.
