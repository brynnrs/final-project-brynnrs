# **Children's Daily Reading <br>& Activity Tracker**

## **My Project Proposal**

### **Build Concept & Reasoning:**
My Children's Daily Reading and Activity Tracker will be a web app that tracks daily reading time, book titles, reading method (independent or with help), and exercise minutes for children. This app will provide an easy way to quickly log details each day, view weekly summaries, create monthly reports, and even set reminders to read and/or track. This will make it easier for parents to complete school forms at the end of each week or month.

### **Main Features**

1. **Daily Log Entry**
   
2. **Weekly Summaries**

3. **Progress Tracking**
  
4. **Reminders and Notifications**
